At the time, the work was outsourced and a direct pickup from print. The stories told were e-commerce focused and there was a huge opportunity to expand into more educational and editorial content. As I had previously developed similar capabilities at e.l.f. Cosmetics, I was uniquely positioned to do the same for this entrepreneurial brand within a larger company.\n\n---\n\n## Relaunch to Responsive\n\nThis project spanned UX/UI work and new content strategy. We optimized user flow, simplified the visual language, and increased time spent on site by making product more discoverable.\n\n[[image chrome=\"mobile\" left=\"/static/case-studies/lab-series/legacy-mobile-hp-scroll.jpg\" right=\"/static/case-studies/lab-series/current-mobile-hp-scroll.jpg\" caption=\"__IMAGE 1__: Legacy home page. __IMAGE 2__: Current experience.
